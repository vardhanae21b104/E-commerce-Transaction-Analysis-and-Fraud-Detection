# E-commerce-Transaction-Analysis-and-Fraud-Detection
*Aim:* To analyze e-commerce transactions and detect potential fraudulent activities using Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) and SQL.

### Steps:

1. *Data Collection:*
   - Use a publicly available dataset or create a synthetic dataset of e-commerce transactions. The dataset should include transaction details such as transaction ID, user ID, product ID, transaction amount, date, time, and other relevant features.

2. *Data Preprocessing:*
   - Clean and preprocess the data using SQL queries to remove duplicates, handle missing values, and normalize data types.

3. *Feature Engineering:*
   - Use SQL to create new features that could be indicative of fraud, such as transaction frequency, average transaction amount per user, and time-based features.

4. *Algorithm Implementation:*
   - Implement data structures like hash maps and priority queues to efficiently manage and process transaction data.
   - Use algorithms such as sorting (to identify unusual transaction amounts) and graph algorithms (to detect suspicious patterns and connections between users and transactions).

5. *Model Training:*
   - Apply machine learning algorithms (e.g., decision trees, random forests, or gradient boosting) to train a fraud detection model. Use DSA concepts to optimize the model's performance.
   - Split the data into training and testing sets to evaluate the model.

6. *Anomaly Detection:*
   - Implement SQL queries to flag transactions that deviate significantly from the norm (anomalies) based on the engineered features.
   - Use clustering algorithms to identify groups of transactions that are likely fraudulent.

7. *Visualization:*
   - Create visualizations using Python libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to represent transaction patterns and detected frauds. Visualize the distribution of transaction amounts, the frequency of transactions over time, and the clusters of fraudulent activities.

### Example Code Snippets:

#### Data Preprocessing with SQL
sql
-- Remove duplicate transactions
DELETE FROM transactions
WHERE rowid NOT IN (
    SELECT MIN(rowid)
    FROM transactions
    GROUP BY transaction_id
);

-- Handle missing values
UPDATE transactions
SET transaction_amount = 0
WHERE transaction_amount IS NULL;


#### Feature Engineering with SQL
sql
-- Calculate the average transaction amount per user
SELECT user_id, AVG(transaction_amount) AS avg_transaction_amount
FROM transactions
GROUP BY user_id;

-- Calculate transaction frequency per user
SELECT user_id, COUNT(transaction_id) AS transaction_count
FROM transactions
GROUP BY user_id;

-- Create time-based features
SELECT transaction_id, user_id, transaction_amount,
       EXTRACT(HOUR FROM transaction_time) AS transaction_hour,
       EXTRACT(DAY FROM transaction_time) AS transaction_day
FROM transactions;


#### Fraud Detection Algorithm in Python
python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report

# Load preprocessed data
data = pd.read_csv('processed_transactions.csv')

# Feature selection
features = data[['avg_transaction_amount', 'transaction_count', 'transaction_hour', 'transaction_day']]
labels = data['is_fraud']

# Split data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(features, labels, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

# Train the model
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict and evaluate
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))


#### Visualization with Python
python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Load data
data = pd.read_csv('processed_transactions.csv')

# Plot transaction amount distribution
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.histplot(data['transaction_amount'], bins=50, kde=True)
plt.title('Transaction Amount Distribution')
plt.xlabel('Transaction Amount')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.show()

# Plot average transaction amount per user
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.barplot(x='user_id', y='avg_transaction_amount', data=data)
plt.title('Average Transaction Amount per User')
plt.xlabel('User ID')
plt.ylabel('Average Transaction Amount')
plt.xticks(rotation=90)
plt.show()


This project involves the use of DSA for optimizing data processing and SQL for efficient data manipulation, along with machine learning techniques for fraud detection, making it a comprehensive and practical data science project
